# PWA Icons Placeholder

This directory should contain the following icon files for PWA and browser notifications:

- icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

These icons will be used for:
1. Browser notifications
2. PWA app icon
3. Add to home screen icon

For now, the browser notifications will work without these icons, but adding them will improve the user experience.

You can generate these icons from your app logo using tools like:

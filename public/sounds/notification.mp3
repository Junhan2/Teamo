# Notification Sound File
# This is a placeholder for the notification sound file.
# You'll need to add an actual MP3 file here.
# You can use a simple notification sound from:
# - https://freesound.org/
# - https://zapsplat.com/
# - Or create your own short notification sound

# For now, we'll use a base64 encoded simple beep sound in the code
